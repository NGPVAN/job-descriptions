Director of Engineering Job Requirements
========================================

There are two primary responsibilities for this position.

Technical owner of one or more applications
-------------------------------------------

As a Director of Engineering, you are in charge of the technical success of your applications.  You should understand them clearly, and have a vision for where they need to go to be successful.  You will be the person ultimately responsible for their performance and stability.  If there is an issue at 2am that requires engineering to resolve, you are the person who will be called.

You should have a good understanding of current performance issues and future risks.  You should use that information to help product prioritize time for high value improvements, and help your engineering teams avoid possible trouble spots.  It is valuable to cultivate positive working relationships with peers in IT and data, as they are invaluable in helping to resolve many different kinds of problems.

You should understand the technology stacks used by your applications, and stay abreast of changes and improvements to them.  You should ensure we are working with the latest tools and technologies, and introduce new ones in a forward-thinking but prudent way.

While the specific responsibility for the position is technical ownership, an engineering director should be focused on the overall health and success of the application.  This means learning the product domain and having opinions about useful functionality, and helping make your coworkers in other departments successful.

Signs of effective technical ownership:

* Well understood (by product and teams) roadmap for technical improvements
* Performance targets exist and demonstrable progress is being made toward them if not yet met
* Consistent reuse of code by engineering teams
* Effective triage during emergencies
* Accurate estimates provided for proposed work
* Teams are consistently on the latest stable version of tools within months of release
* New technologies introduced to product provide clear value and continue to gain mindshare and respect for years after introduction

Signs of ineffective technical ownership:

* Constant fire fighting of technical issues
* No performance targets or no plan to reach performance targets
* Teams doing work that ends up having no or negative impact on technical goals
* Duplicate and/or contradictory code or dependencies built into application
* Gross over or underestimation of potential projects
* Dependencies on out of date tools or nearly dead technologies

Manager of one or more teams
----------------------------

Every development team is a significant investment by the company, and it is your job to make sure they are all able to excel.  It would be impossible to provide a bullet point list of all the characteristics of a good manager, and people can have different styles without one of them necessarily being wrong.  In general though, teams will be most successful when they are talented, motivated, and focused.  As director, you must ensure that we recruit talented engineers, that they understand and care about not just the codebase and tools but the company goals for the product, and that they are able to accomplish their tasks without myriad interruptions or busy work.

Signs of effective management:

* Low voluntary turnover
* Good professional development of staff
	* Both technically and within the domain
	* Developers continue to become more productive over time
* Teams work effectively as a unit but share information across department
* Non-engineering staff happy with work of engineering teams
* Strong performers recruited
	* Good bench - feeling that others are ready to step up if a manager leaves

Signs of ineffective management:

* High turnover
* Poor communication between engineers and other departments
* Poor overall departmental skill
	* No accountability for weak performers
	* Poor developers given offers
	* Developers stagnate instead of becoming better and better
	* Need to recruit externally for manager turnover
