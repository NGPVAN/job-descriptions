The Systems Engineer will plan, implement and maintain a mix of hardware, software and services in support of our customer-facing applications. Because we're a software company, familiarity with the software development lifecycle is extremely helpful. The candidate will be expected to use and participate in maintaining our script resources.

Like most IT teams, we handle a mixture of break/fix and project work. This position will focus on production, internet-facing systems. We expect the Systems Engineer to spend about half of their time on projects, and about half on triage and troubleshooting. Systems Engineer candidates should be comfortable interacting with staff at all levels of technical expertise. Because our team is fairly small and flat, all IT staff provide some internal end-user technical support.

This is a full-time position with some on-site work in Boston.  Our team values communication and documentation.  We have daily meetings to collaborate and make decisions. We document our work in a combination of JIRA and Confluence.  We use Slack all day.

## Responsibilities

* Research, recommend, plan and deploy systems
* Support production, internet-facing systems
* Occasional planned work outside of regular business hours (with comp time)
* Participate in on-call PagerDuty rotation (typically after 6 months)

## Actual Minimum Requirements

These are really the actual minimum requirements - if you don't meet them your application will not be considered, and if you do meet them we encourage you to apply even if you feel underqualified.

	* Windows Server operating systems
	* Web, email, and database application servers
* 2+ years of experience with scripting languages (PowerShell, Windows batch file, VBScript, Bash, etc.)
* Thorough understanding of IP networking

Because we work with a variety of hardware devices, some quite large, candidates should be able to lift 30 lbs.
