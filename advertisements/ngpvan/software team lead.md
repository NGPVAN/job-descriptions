# Software Team Lead

*Somerville, MA* or *Washington, DC*

## Why EveryAction?

EveryAction is the fastest-growing and second-largest software company for nonprofits.  We provide SaaS tools, built around a unified CRM, that empower our clients to be more effective and do more good.  We do exciting and important work that has a significant impact on promoting civil rights, social justice, and environmental responsibility.  We've worked closely with every major Democratic Presidential campaign since Obama 2008, and our non-profit clients include organizations like Audubon, Covenant House, Feeding America, NAACP, and Special Olympics.

We do our best to hire people who are smart, dedicated, and not too full of themselves.  We value work-life balance and our benefits package demonstrates that: 5 weeks of paid time off, 11 annual holidays, 12 weeks of paid parental leave, 100% premium-paid health/dental/vision, employer retirement contributions, and an ongoing education allowance.

## Job Description

At EveryAction, as Software Team Lead you would be the manager and tech lead of one of our Scrum development teams.  Each team is  made up of 2-3 other Software Engineers of varying seniority, as well as one QA Analyst or QA Engineer dedicated to the team's projects.

When bringing on a Software Team Lead from outside the company, we prefer they spend the first 3 or so months as a member of an existing team in order to learn the stack and domain.

Specifically, a team lead's week to week responsibilities include:

* Working with team's Product Manager to estimate and refine future work
* Contributing to the development of active team projects
* Managing team members to improve/maintain high performance and morale
* Identifying external obstacles to project success and overcoming them

## Our Stack

* ASP.NET 4.5+ C#
  * Webforms / MVC
  * Some legacy VB.NET
* React
  * Some legacy Angular 1/2
* Microsoft SQL
  * Server 2017 + Azure SQL
* Hybrid Cloud

##  Minimum Requirements For Resume Consideration

You need at least two years of software engineering experience to be considered for this job.  (We don't make exceptions to our minimum requirements for external candidates, and instead try to set them low enough to include all potentially qualified candidates.)

## Useful Skills

We don't require that you have experience with all of this to begin with, but it is directly relevant to the role.

* Working knowledge of web scalability problems and patterns
* Experience with some or all of our tech stack
* Experience managing software engineers
