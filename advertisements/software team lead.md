# Software Team Lead

*Somerville, MA* or *Washington, DC*

## Job Description

At EveryAction, as Software Team Lead you would be the manager and probably the tech lead of one of our Scrum development teams.  Each team is  made up of 2-3 other Software Engineers of varying seniority, as well as one QA Analyst or QA Engineer dedicated to the team's projects.  We try to colocate teams as much as possible, though as of the time of this writing Covid is making that irrelevant. 

When bringing on a Software Team Lead from outside the company, we prefer they spend the first 3 or so months as a member of an existing team in order to learn the stack and domain.

Specifically, a team lead's week to week responsibilities include:

* Working with team's Product Manager to estimate and refine future work
* Contributing to the development of active team projects
* Managing team members to improve/maintain high performance and morale
* Identifying external obstacles to project success and overcoming them

##  Minimum Requirements For Resume Consideration

You need at least two years of software engineering experience to be considered for this job.  (We don't make exceptions to our minimum requirements for external candidates, and instead try to set them low enough to include all potentially qualified candidates.)

## Our Stack

* ASP.NET 4.5+ C#
  * Webforms / MVC
  * Some legacy VB.NET
* React
  * Some legacy Angular 1/2
* Microsoft SQL
  * Server 2017 + Azure SQL
* Hybrid Cloud

## Useful Skills

We don't require that you have experience with all of this to begin with, but it is directly relevant to the role.

* Working knowledge of web scalability problems and patterns
* Experience with some or all of our tech stack
* Experience managing software engineers
