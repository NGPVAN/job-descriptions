# Software Engineering Intern
*Boston, MA* or *Washington, DC*

Do you have a passion for creating modern and compelling applications with simple, readable and elegant code?

Do you love to be working with cutting edge technology and tools?

Do you want to work on products that help make the world a better place?

Do you want to do all of those things while learning a lot and having a ton of fun over the summer?

If so, this is your opportunity to work on industry-leading applications and use the latest web technology while doing it. Some things we work with: React, C# ASP.NET, Elasticsearch, and Node.

If this listing looks a lot like our full-time software engineer job description, that's no accident. While we acknowledge they have less experience, we expect our interns to be shipping real code by the end of the summer.

## Responsibilities

* Design good systems
* Write good code
* Ship working software
* Learn about real-world software development

## What we're looking for

You don't have to fit all of these bullets, but if you don't fit any of them this is probably not the right job for you:

* Experience working with web applications
* Experience with an object-oriented language
* Javascript skills - React / Angular experience is great
* Great communication skills
