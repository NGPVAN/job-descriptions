# Software Engineer, Security

*Boston, MA*, *Washington, DC*, or *Remote, USA*

## Why work here

Aside from the general fact that we offer jobs that pay money for labor, at EveryAction we work on behalf of the some the best campaigns and non-profits in the world, many of whom are of above-average interest to bad guys.  If you want to make a difference doing application security work, there aren't a whole lot of places where your work would matter more.  It's also a great place to work from a culture and coworker standpoint, although I don't recommend believing every job description that makes that claim.  Do believe it for this one, though!

## Responsibilities

* Secure existing applications
* Make sure new systems are secure by design
* Ship good products (often)

## What We're Looking For

You don't have to fit all of these bullets, but if you don't fit any of them this is probably not the right job for you.

* Working knowledge of web security standards (OWASP, common Auth patterns, etc.)
* Experience with JavaScript, C#, and/or ASP.NET
* Great communication skills
