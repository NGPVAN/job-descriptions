* Participate in Code Reviews, respond to Pull Requests and provide feedback to your fellow engineers
* Understand how the work that you do directly impacts our customers

What we're looking for
----------------------
You don't have to fit all of these bullets, but if you don't fit any of them this is probably not the right job for you.

* Proficiency in web design: HTML, CSS and JavaScript
* Experience with one or more front-end frameworks: ReactJS, AngularJS, VueJS etc
* Experience with Bootstrap and SCSS
* Experience dealing with dynamic web applications (ASP.NET and C# especially)
