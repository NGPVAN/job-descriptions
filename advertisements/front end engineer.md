 # Front End Engineer

*Somerville, MA*

The Front-End Engineer is a member of the UI Engineering team. That team works across the entire product suite to unify and modernize our enterprise-level CRM platform by building and supporting our UI framework, ProgressUI, as well as assisting engineering teams with web design. This person works with product managers, product designers, and engineers to build and improve the front-end experience of our products and evangelizes best practices around quality, performance, and stability of front-end code. An ideal candidate has a strong background in web design (HTML & CSS), a good grasp of JavaScript and front-end frameworks, and isn't terrified of digging into the back end code to find out how to make the front end better.

## Responsibilities

* Own and extend our Progress UI framework to maintain product design standards for our enterprise-level CRM platform
* Create rich product experiences that merge with back-end components primarily using JavaScript, HTML5 & CSS3, Sass, and similar modern technologies
* Ensure existing and new components are well-designed, well-tested, and cross-browser compatible
* Continuously push the limits in modern CSS (flexbox, SCSS, etc.), ReactJS and other frameworks
* Participate in Code Reviews, respond to Pull Requests and provide feedback to your fellow engineers
* Understand how the work that you do directly impacts our customers

## What We're Looking For

You don't have to fit all of these bullets, but if you don't fit any of them this is probably not the right job for you.

* Proficiency in web design: HTML, CSS and JavaScript
* Experience with one or more front-end frameworks: ReactJS, AngularJS, VueJS etc
* Experience with Bootstrap and SCSS
* Experience dealing with dynamic web applications (ASP.NET and C# especially)
* Great communication skills
* Kind of weird dedication to UI/UX best practices and cross-browser compatibility if you really think about it

## Actual Minimum Requirements

Candidates without at least one year experience with front-end technologies will not be considered.
