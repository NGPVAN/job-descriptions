# Software Engineering Intern

*Boston, MA*, *Washington, DC*, or *Remote, US*

Do you have a passion for creating modern and compelling applications with simple, readable and elegant code?

Do you want to work on products that help make the world a better place?

Do you want to do all of those things while learning a lot and having a ton of fun over the summer?

If so, this is your opportunity to work on industry-leading applications and use the latest web technology while doing it. Some things we work with: React, C# ASP.NET, Elasticsearch, and Node.

If this listing looks a lot like our full-time software engineer job description, that's no accident. While we acknowledge they have less experience, we expect our interns to be shipping real code by the end of the summer.

## Responsibilities

* Design good systems
* Write good code
* Ship working software
* Learn about real-world software development

## What We're Looking For

You don't have to fit all of these bullets, but if you don't fit any of them this is probably not the right job for you:

* Experience working with web applications
* Experience with an object-oriented language
* Javascript skills - React / Angular experience is great
* Great communication skills
