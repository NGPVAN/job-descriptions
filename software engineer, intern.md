# NGP VAN Development Internships (paid)

NGP VAN is the leading provider of technology to Democratic political campaigns, labor unions, and progressive nonprofits across the country. At NGP VAN, we want interns to get real world rapid application development experience in a team-oriented environment. To achieve that, our internship program is focused on recruiting a group of enthusiastic programmers to build key features for our products, see those through to release, and receive and respond to feedback from our broad base of users.

Here are some example projects our past interns have worked on:

- Social Organizing - For too long, campaigns have focused on cutting lists of voters and randomly assigning volunteers the task of contacting them. Now that there is easy access to social graphs, we want to help campaigns use this new set of data. By leveraging existing relationships, we can ensure that every contact made by every volunteer is the most valuable contact they can make. To that end we've built out and continue to improve a new system with social aspects infused throughout, geared towards any volunteer with an Internet connection and a Facebook account.

- Turf Cutting - In the past, campaigns have created walk lists by printing out entire precincts and dividing up the lists by street. Our Turf Cutting tool lets staff or volunteers plot all their target voters on a map, visually divide them up into compact groups, and then provide those lists and maps to their volunteers. Last year's interns added efficient automatic clustering to the tool, and we are continually improving and expanding the functionality.

We enjoy tailoring summer projects to match the skills and interests of our interns, including opportunities to work on visualizations, analytic tools, and fast algorithms on the client or server side.

To best accommodate summer availability our program will generally run 10 weeks, from Monday, June 9, 2014 to Friday, August 15. Start and end dates are flexible. 

Our goal with this program is to find developers who share our passion for applying technology to progressive causes, for future permanent employment. We also appreciate fresh perspectives on how to approach the data problems of political campaigns and allied organizations.
